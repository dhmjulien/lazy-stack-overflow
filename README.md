# Lazy Stack Overflow

⚙️ Chrome extension to instantly get your answer on Stack Overflow (yup, I'm lazy).

✔️ It also works on all StackExchange websites like askubuntu.com, superuser.com, serverfault.com and more... (find the official list [here](https://stackexchange.com/sites))

## How to use it ?

👉 When you get to a thread, click on the extension's button to scroll automatically to the "accepted" answer when there's one.

🖱 You can also double-click on code snippets on the page to copy them to your clipboard!
